faq,What is the purpose of this project?,"The purpose of this project is to provide a repository of interatomic potentials for atomistic simulations (e.g. molecular dynamics) with comparison tools and reference experimental and ab-initio data in order to facilitate the evaluation of these potentials for particular applications. Our goal is not to judge that any particular potential is ""the best"" because the best interatomic potential may depend on the problem being considered. For example, some interatomic potentials which have been fit only to the properties of solid phases may model solid surface properties better than one fit with solid and liquid properties. However, the second potential will probably better represent properties which have a strong liquid contribution (e.g. crystal-melt interfacial properties). Additionally, we are not limiting the repository to a single class of material (e.g. metals), interatomic potential format (e.g. Embedded-Atom Method), or software package. As we obtain interatomic potentials for other materials or in other formats, we will include them with proper website modifications."
formats,What are the potential formats?,"<b>Due to the range of formats, we are not able to guarantee that the interatomic potentials will work with particular software packages. Rather, we provide the interatomic potentials with appropriate citation information, and it is up to the user to determine whether a potential will work with given software and produce the expected results.</b></p>  <p>Steve Plimpton has a very nice description of various potential and file  formats on the <a href=""http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/pair_style.html"" class=""external"">LAMMPS website</a>. These include the <b>Embedded-atom method (EAM) funcfl</b> and <b>setfl</b> formats, <b>Finnis-Sinclair</b> potentials, and <b>Modified embedded-atom method (MEAM)</b> potentials. More detailed information can be found there.   In addition to LAMMPS, the EAM funcfl and setfl formats are compatible with DYNAMO, the molecular dynamics program developed by Daw, et al. <a href=""faq.html#Daw"">(1)</a>, though recent versions of LAMMPS have made some modifications to the header information.

graphs,"I've downloaded a file and plotted it, but the graphs don't look like the figures in the paper.  Why?","There can be several reasons for this.  One is file formatting.   Different developers and software packages use different data and file formats to present their interatomic potentials.</p>  <p>Even with the same file/data format, invariant transformations in the EAM format mean that different parameterizations of the interatomic potentials can look completely different but yield the same physical properties.  This is especially true for alloys.  The issue of invariant transformations is discussed in several places.  Among them are: </p> <UL> <LI>Y. Mishin, ""Interatomic potentials for metals,"" in <em>Handbook of Materials Modeling</em>, edited by S. Yip (Springer, Dordrect, The Netherlands, 2005), Chap. 2.2, pp. 459-478. <LI>A.E. Carlsson, ""Beyond pair potentials in elemental transition metals and semiconductors,"" in <em>Solid State Physics</em>, Volume 43, Ehrenreich and Turnbull (eds.)
