The potential reproduces a range of physical properties, such as the lattice constant, cohesive energy, elastic constants, vacancy formation energy, surface energy, and the melting point of pure bismuth. The calculations are done for the rhombohedral ground state of Bi. The results show good agreement with density functional theory and experimental data. The developed MEAM potential for bismuth is useful for material and mechanical behavior studies of the pure material at different conditions and sets the stage for the development of interatomic potentials for bismuth alloys or other bismuth compounds.",
