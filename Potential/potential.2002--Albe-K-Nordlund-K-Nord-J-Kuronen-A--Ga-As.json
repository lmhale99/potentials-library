The functional form is based on the bond-order scheme as devised by Abell-Tersoff and Brenner, while a systematic fitting scheme starting from the Pauling relation is used for determining all adjustable parameters. Reference data were taken from experiments if available, or computed by self-consistent total-energy calculations within the local density-functional theory otherwise. For fitting the parameters, only structural data of the metallic phases of gallium and arsenide as well as those of different GaAs phases were used. A number of tests on point defect properties, surface properties, and melting behavior have been performed afterward in order to validate the accuracy and transferability of the potential model, but were not part of the fitting procedure. While point defect properties and surfaces with low As content are found to be in good agreement with literature data, the description of As-rich surface reconstructions is not satisfactory. In the case of molten GaAs we find support for a structural model based on experiment that indicates a polymerized arsenic phase in the melt.",
