The employed formalism makes these potentials applicable across all interatomic distances without the need for any ambiguous splining to the well-established short-range Ziegler-Biersack-Littmark universal pair potential.

Our formalism provides a complete description of the interatomic potentials that can be used at any energy scale, and thus, eliminates the inherent ambiguity of splining different potentials generated to study different kinds of atomic-materials behavior.
