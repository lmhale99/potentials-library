The potential describes lattice properties of Ni<sub>3</sub>Al, point defects, planar faults, as well as the γ and γ′ fields on the Ni–Al phase diagram. The potential is applied to calculate the energies of coherent Ni/Ni<sub>3</sub>Al interphase boundaries with three different crystallographic orientations. Depending on the orientation, the interface energy varies between 12 and 46 mJ/m2. Coherent γ/γ′ interfaces existing at high temperatures are shown to be more diffuse and are likely to have a lower energy than Ni/Ni<sub>3</sub>Al interfaces.",

This version differs from the last LAMMPS version in that it explicitly sets F(rho=0) = 0 so that isolated atoms have an energy of 0.0. The two LAMMPS versions behave nearly identically except at very small r and at r near the cutoff. See \"Version 2 notes.pdf\" for a more detailed comparison of the two versions."
