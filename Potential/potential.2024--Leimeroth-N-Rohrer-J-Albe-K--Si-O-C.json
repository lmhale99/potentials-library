Consequently, a key challenge is a thorough knowledge of structure–property relations in the system. In this work, we fit an atomic cluster expansion potential to a set of actively learned density-functional theory training data spanning a wide configurational space. We demonstrate the ability of the potential to produce realistic amorphous structures and rationalize the formation of different morphologies of the turbostratic free carbon phase. Finally, we relate the materials stiffness to its composition and microstructure, finding a delicate dependence on Si-C bonds that contradicts commonly assumed relations to the free carbon phase.",
