The model gives a good comparison with the experimental and ab initio data for the lattice constants of \u03b1-U and \u03b3-U, the elastic constants, the room-temperature isotherm, the normal density isochore, the bond-angle distribution functions and the vacancy formation energies. The calculated melting line of uranium at pressures up to 80 GPa and the temperature of the \u03b1-\u03b3 transition at 3 GPa agree well with the experimental phase diagram of uranium.",
