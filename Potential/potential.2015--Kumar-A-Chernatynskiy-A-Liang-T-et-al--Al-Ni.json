The potential has been optimized for Ni<sub>3</sub>Al, or the \u03b3' phase in Ni-based superalloys. The formation energies predicted for other Ni\u2013Al phases are in reasonable agreement with first-principles results. The potential further predicts good mechanical properties for Ni<sub>3</sub>Al, which includes the values of the complex stacking fault (CSF) and the anti-phase boundary (APB) energies for the (1\u20091\u20091) and (1\u20090\u20090) planes. It is also used to investigate dislocation propagation across the Ni<sub>3</sub>Al (1\u20091\u20090)\u2013Ni (1\u20091\u20090) interface, and the results are consistent with simulation results reported in the literature. The potential is further used in combination with a recent COMB3 potential for Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> to investigate the Ni<sub>3</sub>Al (1\u20091\u20091)\u2013Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (0\u20090\u20090 1) interface, which has not been modeled previously at the classical atomistic level due to the lack of a reactive potential to describe both Ni<sub>3</sub>Al and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> as well as interactions between them. The calculated work of adhesion for this interface is predicted to be 1.85 J m<sup>\u22122</sup>, which is in agreement with available experimental data. The predicted interlayer distance is further consistent with the available first-principles results for Ni (1\u20091\u20091)\u2013Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (0\u20090\u20090\u20091).",
