Here, we integrate configurational sampling using classical force fields with active learning to automate and accelerate the generation of Gaussian approximation potentials (GAP) for molten salts. This methodology reduces the number of expensive <i>ab initio</i> evaluations required for training set generation to O(100), enabling the facile parametrization of a molten LiCl GAP model that exhibits a 19000-fold speedup relative to AIMD. The developed molten LiCl GAP model is applied to sample extended spatiotemporal scales, permitting new physical insights into molten LiCl's coordination structure as well as experimentally validated predictions of structures, densities, self-diffusion constants, and ionic conductivities. The developed methodology significantly lowers the barrier to the <i>in silico</i> understanding and design of molten salts across the periodic table.",
