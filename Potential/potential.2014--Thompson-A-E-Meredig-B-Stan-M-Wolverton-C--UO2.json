We compare the defect energetics and vibrational properties of the IPR-fit potential with other interatomic potentials, density functional theory calculations, and experimental phonon dispersions. We find that among previously published potentials examined, there is no potential that simultaneously yields accurate defect energetics and accurate vibrational properties. In contrast, our IPR-fit potential produces both accurate defects and the best agreement with the experimental phonon dispersion and phonon density of states. This combination of accurate properties makes this IPR-fit potential useful for simulating UO2 in high temperature, defect-rich environments typical for nuclear fuel. Additionally, we verify that density functional theory with a Hubbard U correction accurately reproduces the experimentally derived UO2 phonon density of states.",
