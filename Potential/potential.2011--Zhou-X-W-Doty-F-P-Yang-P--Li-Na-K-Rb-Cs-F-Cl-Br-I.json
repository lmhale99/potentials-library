Traditionally, relative sizes of cations and anions have been used to explain coordination of ions within the crystals. Such approaches assume atoms to be hard spheres and they cannot explain the observed structures of some crystals. Here we develop an atomistic method and use it to explore the structure-determining factors beyond the limitations of the hard sphere approach. Our approach is based upon a calibrated interatomic potential database that uses independent intrinsic bond lengths to measure atomic sizes. By carrying out extensive atomistic simulations, striking relationships among intrinsic bond lengths are discovered to determine the B1 (NaCl), B2 (CsCl), and B3 (zinc-blende) structure of binary ionic compounds.",
