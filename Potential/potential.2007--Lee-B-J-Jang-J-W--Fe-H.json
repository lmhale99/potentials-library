The potential parameters were determined by fitting to experimental data on the dilute heat of solution of hydrogen in body-centered cubic (bcc) and face-centered cubic (fcc) Fe,  the vacancy\u2013hydrogen binding energy in bcc Fe, and to a first-principles calculation  for the lattice parameter and bulk modulus of a hypothetical NaCl-type FeH. The  potential accurately reproduces the known physical properties of hydrogen as an  interstitial solute element in bcc and fcc Fe. The applicability of the potential to atomistic approaches for investigating interactions between hydrogen atoms and  other defects such as vacancies, dislocations and grain boundaries, and also for  investigating the effects of hydrogen on various deformation and mechanical behaviors of iron is demonstrated.",
