Then, the element segregation characteristics and thermal stability of Ni-Pd bimetallic nanoparticles were investigated by Monte Carlo method and molecular dynamics method. The results show that the chemical ordering pattern of Pd<sub>x</sub>Ni<sub>1-x</sub> nanoparticle is the result of the competition of surface energy, strain energy, bond energy and interface energy. When a small amount of Pd atoms are substitutionally doped into the Ni nanoparticle, all the Pd atoms will be segregated on the surface and dispersed. The synergistic effect of Ni atoms and Pd atoms in the surface will improve the catalytic activity and carbon deposition resistance of Pd<sub>x</sub>Ni<sub>1-x</sub> nanoparticle catalyst in methane dry reforming reaction. Increasing the doping amount of Pd atoms will gradually reduce the melting point of Pd<sub>x</sub>Ni<sub>1-x</sub> nanoparticle, thereby reducing its sintering resistance.",
