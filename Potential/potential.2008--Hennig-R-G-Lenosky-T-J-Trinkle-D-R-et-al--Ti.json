Optimization of the parameters of a modified embedded atom potential to a database of density-functional calculations yields an accurate and transferable potential as verified by comparison to experimental and density-functional data for phonons, surface and stacking fault energies, and energy barriers for homogeneous martensitic transformations. Molecular-dynamics simulations map out the pressure-temperature phase diagram of titanium. For this potential the martensitic phase transformation between \u03b1 and \u03b2 appears at ambient pressure and 1200 K, between \u03b1 and \u03c9 at ambient conditions, between \u03b2 and \u03c9 at 1200 K and pressures above 8 GPa, and the triple point occurs at 8 GPa and 1200 K. Molecular-dynamics explorations of the kinetics of the martensitic \u03b1\u2212\u03c9 transformation show a fast moving interface with a low interfacial energy of 30 meV/\u00c5<sup>2</sup>.
