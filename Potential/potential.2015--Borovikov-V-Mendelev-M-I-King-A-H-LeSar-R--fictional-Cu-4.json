Dr. Mendelev noted that these \"are fictional potentials. MCu3 is a realistic potential for Cu; it is the same as <a href=\"https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/entry/2013--Mendelev-M-I-King-A-H--Cu/\">2013--Mendelev-M-I-King-A-H--Cu</a> The rest of potentials were developed using exactly the same fitting procedure except of the target value for the stacking fault energy (SFE) which was varied. The potentials are designed to study the effect of SFE on the mechanical behavior of fcc metals. I also attached a table with the some properties by these potentials.\" The table is in PotentialProperties_MCu.pdf."
