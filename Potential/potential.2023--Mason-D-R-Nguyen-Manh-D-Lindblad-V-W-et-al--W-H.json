The binding energies of H to point defects are very similar to those in Wang et al 2017, and the formation energies of larger defect clusters very similar to 2017--Mason-D-R-Nguyen-Manh-D-Becquart-C-S--W.  The main improvements over Wang et al are a) better relaxation volumes of H-decorated defects and b) better binding of H to surface."
