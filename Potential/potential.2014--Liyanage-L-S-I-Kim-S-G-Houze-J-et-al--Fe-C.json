Previously developed Fe and C single-element potentials were used to develop a Fe-C alloy MEAM potential, using a statistics-based optimization scheme to reproduce structural and elastic properties of cementite, the interstitial energies of C in bcc Fe, and heat of formation of Fe-C alloys in L12 and B1 structures. The stability of cementite was investigated by molecular dynamics simulations at high temperatures. The nine single-crystal elastic constants for cementite were obtained by computing total energies for strained cells. Polycrystalline elastic moduli for cementite were calculated from the single-crystal elastic constants of cementite. The formation energies of (001), (010), and (100) surfaces of cementite were also calculated. The melting temperature and the variation of specific heat and volume with respect to temperature were investigated by performing a two-phase (solid/liquid) molecular dynamics simulation of cementite. The predictions of the potential are in good agreement with first-principles calculations and experiments.",
