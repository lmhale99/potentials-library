In this paper, we generalize the spectral neighbor analysis potential (SNAP) model to bcc-fcc binary alloy systems. We demonstrate that machine-learned SNAP models can yield significant improvements even over the well-established high-performing embedded atom method (EAM) and modified EAM potentials for fcc Cu and Ni. We also report on the development of a SNAP model for the fcc Ni-bcc Mo binary system by machine learning a carefully constructed large computed data set of elemental and intermetallic compounds. We demonstrate that this binary Ni-Mo SNAP model can achieve excellent agreement with experiments in the prediction of a Ni-Mo phase diagram as well as near-DFT accuracy in the prediction of many key properties, such as elastic constants, formation energies, melting points, etc., across the entire binary composition range. In contrast, the existing Ni-Mo EAM has significant errors in the prediction of the phase diagram and completely fails in binary compounds. This paper provides a systematic model development process for multicomponent alloy systems, including an efficient procedure to optimize the hyperparameters in the model fitting, and paves the way for long-time large-scale simulations of such systems.",
