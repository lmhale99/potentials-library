The calculated heat of fusion and elastic constants agree well with experiments. The surface tension is calculated with a direct Monte Carlo evaluation of the free energy required to create the surface. The calculated surface tension is found to be about 220 ergs/cm<sup>2</sup>, in good agreement with experimental estimates.
