The cross-interaction functions have been fitted to first-principles data generated in this work. The potential has been extensively tested against first-principles energies not included in the fitting database and applied to molecular dynamics simulations of wetting and dewetting of Cu on Ta. We find that a Cu film placed on a Ta (110) surface dewets from it, forming a Cu droplet on top of a stable Cu monolayer. We also observe that a drop of liquid Cu placed on a clean Ta (110) surface spreads over it as a stable monolayer, while the extra Cu atoms remain in the drop. The stability of a Cu monolayer and instability of thicker Cu films are consistent with recent experiments and first-principles calculations. This agreement demonstrates the utility of the potential for atomistic simulations of Cu-Ta interfaces.",

More information and a correction can be found in the <a href=\"faq.html#ADP\">FAQ</a>. <b>Update 17 Jan. 2014:</b> Prof. Mishin noted that \"Our ADP Ta potential has a known error: the elastic constants predicted by the potential as a factor of two different from those reported in the paper. This was the result of a bug in the fitting code that was used during the potential development. All other properties are exactly as reported in the paper. The mixed Cu-Ta interactions are also fine. However, because of this error in the elastic constants, the potential cannot be recommended for studying mechanical properties of pure Ta.\" <b>Update:</b> The 2015--Purja-Pun-G-P--Cu-Ta ADP potential has supplanted this potential."
