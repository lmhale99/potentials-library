In this study, an interatomic potential (2NNMEAM + Qeq) for the Li-Co-O ternary system is developed to carry out molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies on lithium cobalt oxides. Potential parameters are optimized so that the potential can successfully reproduce fundamental materials properties (structural, elastic, thermodynamic and migration properties) of various compounds of sub-binary and lithium cobalt ternary oxide systems. Through MD simulations, we investigate lithium diffusion properties (activation energy for lithium migration and diffusion coefficient) in layered Li<sub>1−x</sub>CoO<sub>2</sub> (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) of various lithium vacancy concentrations. We find that the lithium vacancy concentration has a significant influence on the activation energy for lithium diffusion and the lithium diffusion coefficient in the Li<sub>1−x</sub>CoO<sub>2</sub> cathode. The developed potential can be further utilized for atomistic simulation studies on other materials phenomena (phase transitions, defect formation, lithiation/delithiation, etc.) in LIB cathode materials.",
