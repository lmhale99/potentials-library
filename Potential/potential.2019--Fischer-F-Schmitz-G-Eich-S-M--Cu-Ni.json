The resulting phase boundaries of the new potential are in very good agreement with a recent CALPHAD prediction. Using this new potential, a high angle symmetrical tilt \u03a35 and a coherent \u03a33 twin grain boundary (GB) are chosen for a systematic investigation of equilibrium GB segregation in the semi-grandcanonical ensemble at temperatures from 400\u202fK to 800\u202fK. Applying thermodynamically accurate integration techniques, the GB formation energies are calculated exactly and as an absolute value for every temperature and composition, which also enables the evaluation of GB excess entropies. The thorough thermodynamic model of GBs developed by Frolov and Mishin is excellently confirmed by the simulations quantitatively, if the impact of both segregation and GB tension on the change in GB formation energy is accounted for. In the case of the \u03a33 coherent GB, it turns out that the change in GB formation energy at low temperatures is for the most part attributed to the GB tension, while segregation only has a small influence. This demonstrated effect of GB tensions should also be taken into account in the interpretation of experiments.",
