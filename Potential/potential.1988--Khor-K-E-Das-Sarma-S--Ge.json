We obtain two basic relationships linking equilibrium interatomic distances and cohesive energies to the coordination number for a large range of phases of silicon. The relationships are also valid for germanium and carbon, covering, in the latter case, double and triple carbon-carbon bonds, where π bonding is important. Based on these ideas we discuss the construction of the universal interatomic potential for these three substances. This potential, which uses very few parameters, should be useful, particularly for surface studies.",
