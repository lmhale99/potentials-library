The functions are determined empirically by fitting to the sublimation energy, equilibrium lattice constant, elastic constants, and vacancy-formation energies of the pure metals and the heats of solution of the binary alloys. The validity of the functions is tested by computing a wide range of properties: the formation volume and migration energy of vacancies, the formation energy, formation volume, and migration energy of divacancies and self-interstitials, the surface energy and geometries of the low-index surfaces of the pure metals, and the segregation energy of substitutional impurities to (100) surfaces.",
