Beyond the well-known silicon dioxide, there are phases with different stoichiometric composition and nanostructured composites. One of the key challenges in understanding the Si-O system is therefore to accurately account for its nanoscale heterogeneity beyond the length scale of individual atoms. Here we show that a unified computational description of the full Si-O system is indeed possible, based on atomistic machine learning coupled to an active-learning workflow. We showcase applications to very-high-pressure silica, to surfaces and aerogels, and to the structure of amorphous silicon monoxide. In a wider context, our work illustrates how structural complexity in functional materials beyond the atomic and few-nanometre length scales can be captured with active machine learning.",

Moreover, it is trained for surfaces of SiO<sub>2</sub> and all high-pressure phases of SiO<sub>2</sub> including the amorphous phase (at least up to 200 GPa). It can be also used for Si surfaces. It should not be used for high-pressure Si and mixtures of Si-SiO<sub>2</sub> under high pressures."
