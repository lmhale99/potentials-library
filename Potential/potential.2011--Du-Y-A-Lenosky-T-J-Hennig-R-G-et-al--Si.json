The silicon tetra\u2010interstitials present an important intermediate structure that can either provide a chain\u2010like nucleation site for extended structures or form a highly stable compact interstitial cluster preventing further growth. In this paper, dimer searches using the tight\u2010binding (TB) model by Lenosky et al. and density functional calculations show that the compact  ground\u2010state I<sup>a</sup><sub>4</sub> and the I<sub>4</sub>\u2010chain are surrounded by high\u2010lying neighboring local minima.\nTo furthermore explore the phase space of tetra\u2010interstitial structures an empirical potential is optimized to a database of silicon defect structures. The minima hopping method combined with this potential extensively searches the energy landscape of tetra\u2010interstitials and discovers several new low\u2010energy I<sub>4</sub> structures. The second lowest\u2010energy I<sub>4</sub> structure turns out to be a distorted ground\u2010state tri\u2010interstitial bound with a single interstitial, which confirms that the ground\u2010state tri\u2010interstitial may serve as a nucleation center for the extended defects in silicon.",
