Under service conditions, structural disorder is usually encountered in these intermetallics, resulting in significant loss of their strengthening functionality. Thus, retaining the degree of order of the L1<sub>2</sub> intermetallics is vital for their long-term reliability and serviceability. In this study, atomistic simulations and rate equation analysis are employed to highlight a notable enhancement in the reordering ability of L1<sub>2</sub> intermetallics by incorporating multiple principal elements. Specifically, we examine the effects of Co and Ti addition on the irradiation-induced disordering and kinetic reordering process of L1<sub>2</sub> intermetallics. Our results reveal that the incorporation of Ti in the Al sublattice can maintain comparable disordering resistance as Ni<sub>3</sub>Al. Better yet, the introduction of Ti or Co fosters vacancy migration, which accelerates the kinetic reordering rate during the defect diffusion stage. A synergistic effect of Ti and Co in promoting kinetic reordering is also observed. Our work thus suggests a promising approach for designing irradiation-resistant multicomponent intermetallics, which can retain a high degree of structural order under irradiation with chemical disorder contributed by desirable compositions.",

                "text": "This potential is designed for simulations focused on understanding and predicting the behavior of irradiation resistance of Ni-Al-Co-Ti system, emphasizing their structural order. The parameters have been refined to accurately reflect the site preference of Ni, Co, Al, and Ti elements in the L1<sub>2</sub> A<sub>3</sub>B intermetallic structure. The potential effectively reproduces key physical properties such as the lattice constants, defect formation energies, and defect kinetics, demonstrating reasonable agreement with experimental data and first-principles calculations. Furthermore, this potential was used to systematically explore the irradiation resistance and kinetic reordering capabilities of the multicomponent intermetallic systems, showing good consistency with experimental observations."
