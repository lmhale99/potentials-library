These additional types of information were incorporated to ensure more reasonable descriptions of atomic interactions at small separations than is provided using standard approaches, such as fitting to the universal binding energy relation.

It better treats radial distances smaller than 0.5 A for use in radiation damage simulations. Update 22 Dec 2010: The file Fe_2.eam was removed because it was found to have an energy of 11.31356 eV/atom for bcc with a=2.855324 A. For archival purposes, the file can be found here.
