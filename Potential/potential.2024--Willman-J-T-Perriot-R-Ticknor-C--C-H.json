A diverse set of stoichiometries were covered in training, including 1:0 (pure carbon), 1:4 (methane), and 1:1 (benzene), and rich bonding environments sampled at supercritical temperatures, hydrogen rich, reactive mixtures where metastable stoichiometries arise, including 1:2 (ethylene) and 1:3 (ethane). A high-fidelity training database was constructed by performing large-scale quantum molecular dynamic simulations [density functional theory (DFT) MD] of diamond, graphite, methane, and benzene. A novel approach to selecting structures from DFT MD is also presented, which allows for the rapid selection of unique DFT MD frames from complex trajectories. Comparisons to DFT and experimental data demonstrate that the presented ACE potential accurately reproduces isotherms, carbon melting curves, radial distribution functions, and shock Hugoniots for carbon and hydrocarbon systems for pressures up to 100 GPa and temperatures up to 6000 K for hydrocarbon systems and up to 9000 K for pure carbon systems. This work delivers a potential that can be used for accurate, large-scale simulations of shocked hydrocarbons and demonstrates a methodology for fitting and validating machine learning interatomic potentials to complex molecular environments, which can be applied to energetic materials in future works.",
