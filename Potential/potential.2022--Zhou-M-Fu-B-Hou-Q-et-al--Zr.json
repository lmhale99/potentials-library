The evolution of defects in Zr under irradiation conditions will directly contribute to the degradation of reactor components. For a better understanding of the evolution process of defects in Zr, a multiscale simulation was performed to study the diffusion behavior of radiation-induced point defects. Because the existing potentials cannot accurately describe the energy differences of stable states self-interstitial atoms (SIAs) in Zr, an embedded atom method potential that can exactly reproduce the energy difference between metastable states and ground states, and the binding energy of divacancy of Zr, was first developed by fitting a potential to point defect properties calculated by density functional theory and other basic crystal properties. Based on the constructed potential, molecular dynamics (MD) and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to investigate the migration of point defects. We determined several frequent migration paths of SIAs by kinetic study, which is rarely reported in previous MD studies. The SIA exhibits obvious anisotropic diffusion characteristics at low temperatures (<600K). The most frequent migration path for SIAs is the jump between the two nearest basal octahedral (BO) sites in the basal plane, which means that SIAs diffuse faster along the basal plane than along the c axis. It is found that diffusion within the basal plane tends to be two-dimensional (2D) diffusion rather than 1D diffusion, and there is a significant correlation effect for diffusion of SIAs along the basal plane. Additionally, the existence of trivacancy-SIA complex was found in the process of divacancy migration, which can inhibit divacancy migration. Monovacancies and divacancies exhibit anisotropic diffusion characteristics in the considered temperature range Divacancies have a much faster diffusion rate than monovacancies in the present MD simulation and can easily dissociate at high temperatures (>900 K). The rapid migration of the divacancies may contribute to the formation of vacancy dislocation loops. These results are meaningful to understand the evolution process of radiation-induced defects.",
