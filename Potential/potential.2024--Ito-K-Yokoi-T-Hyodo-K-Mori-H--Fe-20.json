                "abstract": "To advance the development of high-strength polycrystalline metallic materials towards achieving carbon neutrality, it is essential to design materials in which the atomic level control of general grain boundaries (GGBs), which govern the material properties, is achieved. However, owing to the complex and diverse structures of GGBs, there have been no reports on interatomic potentials capable of reproducing them. This accuracy is essential for conducting molecular dynamics analyses to derive material design guidelines. In this study, we constructed a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) with density functional theory (DFT) accuracy to model the energy, atomic structure, and dynamics of arbitrary grain boundaries (GBs), including GGBs, in α-Fe. Specifically, we employed a training dataset comprising diverse atomic structures generated based on crystal space groups. The GGB accuracy was evaluated by directly comparing with DFT calculations performed on cells cut near GBs from nano-polycrystals, and extrapolation grades of the local atomic environment based on active learning methods for the entire nano-polycrystal. Furthermore, we analyzed the GB energy and atomic structure in α-Fe polycrystals through large-scale molecular dynamics analysis using the constructed MLIP. The average GB energy of α-Fe polycrystals calculated by the constructed MLIP is 1.57 J/m<sup>2</sup>, exhibiting good agreement with experimental predictions. Our findings demonstrate the methodology for constructing an MLIP capable of representing GGBs with high accuracy, thereby paving the way for materials design based on computational materials science for polycrystalline materials.",
