Many properties of germanene were extracted using both original and optimized Tersoff potentials and they compared with the corresponding density functional theory data. According to the results, the optimized Tersoff potential provides a significant improvement in many structural, thermodynamic, mechanical, and thermal properties of geramanene.",
