These additional types of information were incorporated to ensure more reasonable descriptions of atomic interactions at small separations than is provided using standard approaches, such as fitting to the universal binding energy relation. The new potentials (provided herein) are, on average, in better agreement with the experimental or first-principles lattice parameter, elastic constants, point-defect energies, bcc\u2013fcc transformation energy, liquid density, liquid structure factor, melting temperature and other properties than other existing EAM iron potentials.",
