The potential is developed based on extensive energetics and atomic configurations of an H atom and H-H interactions in Fe from density functional theory calculations. In detail, the potential is parameterized by fitting not only to a single H atom in the perfect bcc Fe lattice and to the properties of H trap binding to a vacancy and surfaces as being done by previous studies, but also to multiple H trapping to a vacancy and H-H interaction in Fe lattice. With such a fitting strategy, the developed potential outperforms existing potentials in its ability not only describing the behaviors of a single H atom in Fe, but also capturing the features of H-H interaction reliably, which is of key importance in revealing H behaviors in local H accumulation around dislocation cores, grain boundaries and crack tips.",
