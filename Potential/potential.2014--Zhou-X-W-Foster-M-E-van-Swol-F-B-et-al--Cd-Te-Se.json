To achieve these devices, however, the quantum dots must be optimized with respect to the structural details at an atomistic level. Molecular dynamics simulations are effective for exploring nano structures at a resolution unattainable by experimental techniques. To enable accurate molecular dynamics simulations of CdTe/CdSe core/shell structures, we have developed a full Cd\u2013Te\u2013Se ternary bond-order potential based on the analytical formalisms derived from quantum mechanical theories by Pettifor et al. A variety of elemental and compound configurations (with coordination varying from 1 to 12) including small clusters, bulk lattices, defects, and surfaces are explicitly considered during potential parametrization. More importantly, enormous iterations are performed to strictly ensure that our potential can simulate the correct crystalline growth of the ground-state structures for Cd, Te, and Se elements as well as CdTe, CdSe, and CdTe<sub>1\u2013x</sub>Se<sub>x</sub> compounds during molecular dynamics vapor deposition simulations. Extensive test simulation results clearly indicate that our new Cd\u2013Te\u2013Se potential has unique advantages over the existing literature potential involving Cd, Te, and Se elements.",
