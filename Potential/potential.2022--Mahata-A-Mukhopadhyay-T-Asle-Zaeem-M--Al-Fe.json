The binary alloys studied in this work are Al-Cu, Al-Fe and Al-Ni. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses are performed on potential parameters based on the perturbation approach. The outcome of the sensitivity analysis shows that some of the MEAM parameters interdependently influence all MEAM model outputs, allowing for the definition of an ordered calibration procedure to target specific MEAM outputs. Using these 2NN-MEAM interatomic potentials, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed to calculate low and high-temperature properties, such as the formation energies of stable phases and unstable intermetallics, lattice parameters, elastic constants, thermal expansion coefficients, enthalpy of formation of solids, liquid mixing enthalpy, and liquidus temperatures at a wide range of compositions. The computed data are compared with the available first principle calculations and experimental data, showing high accuracy of the 2NN-MEAM interatomic potentials. In addition, the liquidus temperature of the Al binary alloys is compared to the phase diagrams determined by the CALPHAD method.",
