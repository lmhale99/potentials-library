The angular-dependent functional form allows a proper description of a large variety of bulk, surface and defect properties, including the Bain path, phonon dispersions, defect diffusivities and defect formation energies. By calculating Gibbs free energies of body-centred cubic (bcc) and face-centred cubic (fcc) iron as a function of temperature, we show that this potential is able to reproduce the transitions from \u03b1-iron to \u03b3-iron and \u03b4-iron before the melting point.
