However, owing to the complex and diverse structures of GGBs, there have been no reports on interatomic potentials capable of reproducing them. This accuracy is essential for conducting molecular dynamics analyses to derive material design guidelines. In this study, we constructed a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) with density functional theory (DFT) accuracy to model the energy, atomic structure, and dynamics of arbitrary grain boundaries (GBs), including GGBs, in α-Fe. Specifically, we employed a training dataset comprising diverse atomic structures generated based on crystal space groups. The GGB accuracy was evaluated by directly comparing with DFT calculations performed on cells cut near GBs from nano-polycrystals, and extrapolation grades of the local atomic environment based on active learning methods for the entire nano-polycrystal. Furthermore, we analyzed the GB energy and atomic structure in α-Fe polycrystals through large-scale molecular dynamics analysis using the constructed MLIP. The average GB energy of α-Fe polycrystals calculated by the constructed MLIP is 1.57 J/m<sup>2</sup>, exhibiting good agreement with experimental predictions. Our findings demonstrate the methodology for constructing an MLIP capable of representing GGBs with high accuracy, thereby paving the way for materials design based on computational materials science for polycrystalline materials.",

In this study, firstly, we evaluate the transferability of the recently proposed α-Fe machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP), constructed from mechanically generated training data based on crystal space groups, to the tensile deformation process of nanopolycrystals. The transferability was evaluated by comparing the physical properties and lattice defect formation energies, which are important in the deformation behavior of nanopolycrystals, with those obtained from density functional theory (DFT) and by comprehensively calculating extrapolation grades based on active learning methods for the local atomic environment in the nanopolycrystal during tensile deformation. These evaluations demonstrate the superior transferability of the MLIP to the tensile deformation of the nanopolycrystals. Furthermore, large-scale molecular dynamics calculations were performed using the MLIP and the most commonly used embedded atom method (EAM) potential to investigate the effect of grain size on the deformation behavior of α-Fe polycrystals and the effect of interatomic potentials on them. The uniaxial tensile deformation behavior of the nanopolycrystals obtained from EAM was qualitatively consistent with that obtained from MLIP. This result supports the results of many studies conducted using EAM and is an important conclusion considering the high computational cost of the MLIP. Furthermore, the construction method for the MLIP used in this study is applicable to other metals. Therefore, this study considerably contributes to the understanding and material design of various metallic materials through the construction of highly accurate MLIPs.",
