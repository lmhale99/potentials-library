Special attention during the development and validation of the potential was paid to the description of vacancies, screw dislocations and planar defects, as well as thermo-mechanical properties. Here, the applicability of the developed model is demonstrated by studying the temperature dependence of the elastic moduli and average atomic displacement in pure metals and concentrated alloys up to the melting point.",
