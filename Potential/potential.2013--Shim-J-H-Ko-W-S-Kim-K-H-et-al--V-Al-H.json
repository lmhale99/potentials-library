The approach was applied to the prediction of the hydrogen permeability in V–Al and V–Ni alloys that are promising for non-Pd hydrogen separation membranes. The predicted permeability of hydrogen decreases, as Al or Ni concentration increases in the alloys. The predicted permeability is in quite good agreement with experimental data available in literature, successfully reproducing the overall trend for the effect of alloying elements, which enables an alloy design of metallic hydrogen permeable membranes.",
