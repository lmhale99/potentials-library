We have separately parameterized to pure Cu and Ti first. So the models are good to use for these pure elements alone, if one wishes. Next, the binary Cu-Ti, Ti-N and Cu-N were fit to the model. And finally, the ternary Cu-Ti-N potential was fit to Cu/TiN metal/ceramic interfacial systems of different orientation relations. The properties that were fit can be found in the paper.\""
