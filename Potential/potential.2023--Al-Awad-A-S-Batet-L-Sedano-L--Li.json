Computer simulations facilitate the study of liquid metal properties, due to mathematical and experimental challenges. A classical-MD EAM potential is parametrized using mechanical and non-mechanical (melting-point) properties to minimize the arbitrariness of functional forms, where the employed pair potential stems from the liquid-state theory to avoid the issue of the uniqueness of the potential. Enhanced performance is obtained for liquid density, energy, structure, diffusivity and shear viscosity of Li, and their temperature-dependencies. In a similar manner, reference experimental and ab initio MD data are used to parametrize a functional to describe Pb-Li pairwise interactions in liquid Pb-Li alloy, which is used with the derived EAM of liquid Li and a reference EAM of liquid Pb to investigate properties of liquid Pb-Li alloy. Enhanced transferability characteristics are obtained for low-in-lithium liquid Pb-Li melts, where Coulombic interactions are negligible. In specific, the exhibited behaviour of Li in liquid lead-lithium eutectic is consistent with findings from ab initio MD methods, and drastically different from predictions of previous C-MD studies which suggested a substantial segregation of Li atoms instead of dispersion.
