Three parameterizations are presented in detail, all of which exhibit positive thermal expansion and produce a non-degenerate configuration for the relaxed 1/2<111> screw dislocation easy core structure. These potentials, along with two other published potentials, are investigated in terms of defect formation volume, early stage dislocation loop clustering energetics, <110> dumbbell interstitial diffusion, and the zero-stress 1/2<111> screw dislocation Peierls barrier and its corresponding kink formation energies.",
