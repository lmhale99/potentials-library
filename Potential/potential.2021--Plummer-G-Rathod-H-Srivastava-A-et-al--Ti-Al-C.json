When compressively loaded parallel to their basal planes, layered crystalline solids first buckle elastically, then nucleate atomic-scale, highly stressed ripplocation boundaries – a process driven by redistributing strain from energetically expensive in-plane bonds to cheaper out-of-plane bonds. The consequences are far reaching as the unique mechanical properties of layered crystalline solids are highly dependent upon their ability to deform by kinking. Moreover, the compressive strength of numerous natural and engineered layered systems depends upon the ease of kinking or lack there of.",

                "text": "This potential was designed for studies of MAX phase deformation, with particular attention paid to replicating the characteristics of basal slip. It successfully captures MAX phase plastic anisotropy, predicting deformation by both basal slip and kinking depending on orientation. Note that this is the second iteration of the 2019--Plummer-G-Tucker-G-J--Ti-Al-C potential, developed over both publications. This iteration is more suitable for deformation studies rather than irradiation tolerance."
