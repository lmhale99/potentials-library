The main attention was paid to the metastable \u03b30-phase that is formed in U-Mo alloys at low temperature. Structure of \u03b30-phase is similar to body-centered tetragonal (bct) lattice with displacement of a central atom in the basic cell along [001] direction. Such displacements have opposite orientations for part of the neighbouring basic cells. In this case, such ordering of the displacements can be designated as antiferro-displacement. Formation of such complex structure may be interpreted through forming of short U-U bonds. At heating, the tetragonal structure transforms into cubic \u03b3s-phase, still showing ordering of central atom displacements. With rise in temperature, \u03b3s-phase transforms to \u03b3-phase with a quasi body-centered cubic (q-bcc) lattice. The local positions of uranium atoms in \u03b3-phase correspond to \u03b3s-phase, however, orientations of the central atom displacements become disordered. Transition from \u03b30 to \u03b3 can be considered as antiferro-to paraelastic transition of order-disorder type. \n\nThis approach to the structure description of uranium alloy allows to explain a number of unusual features found in the experiments: anisotropy of lattice at low temperature; remarkably high self-diffusion mobility in \u03b3-phase; decreasing of electrical resistivity at heating for some alloys. In addition, important part of this work is the development of new interatomic potential for U-Mo system made with taking into account details of studied structures.",

This \"bug\" led to the sake of the energy conservation during high-temperature (or long) calculations for pure Mo or U-Mo alloy. I made an additional check and found a small potential compilation issue leading to this energy drift. I fixed the file, so now it can be safely used with the time-step = 0.5 fs, even for long runs at high temperatures (the test was made for 1500K).\""
