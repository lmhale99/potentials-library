        "question": "What are the potential formats?",
        "answer": "<b>Disclaimer:</b> Due to the range of formats, we are not able to guarantee that the interatomic potentials will work with particular software packages. Rather, we provide the interatomic potentials with appropriate citation information, and it is up to the user to determine whether a potential will work with given software and produce the expected results.</p><p><b>LAMMPS formats:</b> Most of the hosted parameter files are in a format compatible with the LAMMPS software.  See the <a href=\"https://www.lammps.org/\">LAMMPS documentation</a> for more details about the specific LAMMPS pair_style formats listed with the implementations.  Note that if the format listed in the repository includes (custom) or (modified), then the potential may require building a modified version of LAMMPS with additional or modified code.</p><p><b>OpenKIM models:</b> The repository provides cross-links to many of the interatomic potentials hosted by <a href=\"https://openkim.org/\">OpenKIM</a>.  Note that the OpenKIM models differ in that they are designed to be installed using the kim-api and do not necessarily have separate parameter files associated with them.  See the OpenKIM documentation for more details about how to setup and use it.</p><p><b>Other formats:</b> Additionally, a variety of other formats are also hosted here. A (non-comprehensive) list is as follows<ul><li><b>IMD option EAM</b> are EAM parameter files for use with the IMD code</li><li><b>EAM setfl</b> are parameter files in the setfl format, but are not directly compatible with the associated LAMMPS pair styles.</li><li><b>SPaSM</b> are EAM parameter file tabulations for use with the SPaSM MD software.</li><li><b>Moldy FS</b> are EAM parameter files for use with the Moldy MD software.</li><li><b>MoldyPSI</b> combines a parameter file with Fortran90 routines to calculate the EAM functions and their derivatives.</li><li><b>Dynamo MEAM</b> are MEAM parameter files in the format used by LAMMPS, but requires a modification of the LAMMPS code to work properly.</li><li><b>MEAM parameters</b> are EAM parameter file tabulations for use with the SPaSM MD software.</li><li><b>MEAM splines</b> are MEAM spline parameter files that are not directly compatible with the associated LAMMPS pair style.</li><li><b>GULP</b> is a parameter file for use with the GULP MD software.</li><li><b>EAM tabulated functions</b> and <b>Finnis-Sinclair tables</b> are tabulations of the EAM potential functions not in the setft format.</li><li><b>ADP tabulated functions</b> are tabulations of the ADP potential functions not in the setft format.</li><li><b>FORTRAN</b> is a FORTRAN script that can be used to generate parameter files.</li><li><b>ASE calculator</b> is an implementation that can be directly used with the ASE python code as a calculator.</li><li><b>deepmd-kit</b> is the implementation and code of an ML potential in the deepmd-kit format.</li><li><b>GAP</b> are <a href=\"https://gap-ml.org/\">Gaussian approximation potentials.</a>  These are in the format used by the <a href=\"https://github.com/libAtoms/QUIP\">QUIP software</a>, which can be interfaced with simulation software such as LAMMPS.</li><li><b>Equations</b> is simply a document that lists the potential's functional form</li></ul>"
