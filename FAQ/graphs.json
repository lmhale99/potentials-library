        "question": "I've downloaded a file and plotted it, but the graphs don't look like the figures in the paper.  Why?",
        "answer": "There can be several reasons for this.  One is file formatting.   Different developers and software packages use different data and file formats to present their interatomic potentials.</p>  <p>Even with the same file/data format, invariant transformations in the EAM format mean that different parameterizations of the interatomic potentials can look completely different but yield the same physical properties.  This is especially true for alloys.  The issue of invariant transformations is discussed in several places.  Among them are: </p> <UL> <LI>Y. Mishin, \"Interatomic potentials for metals,\" in <em>Handbook of Materials Modeling</em>, edited by S. Yip (Springer, Dordrect, The Netherlands, 2005), Chap. 2.2, pp. 459-478. <LI>A.E. Carlsson, \"Beyond pair potentials in elemental transition metals and semiconductors,\" in <em>Solid State Physics</em>, Volume 43, Ehrenreich and Turnbull (eds.) (1990). </UL> To compare different EAM interatomic potentials, the <em>effective pair format</em> should be used."
