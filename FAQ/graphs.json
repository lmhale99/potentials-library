        "question": "I've downloaded a file and plotted it, but the graphs of the functions don't look like the figures in the paper.  Why?",
        "answer": "Differences in the plots of the graphical form of the potentials and what is reported in the associated publications can be due to a variety of reasons:<ul><li><b>File formatting and units.</b>  Different developers and software packages use different data and file formats to present their interatomic potentials.  As such, parameter files that implement the same potential into different simulation codes can substantially differ in what parameters and function tabulations are included, and what units those values need to be in.  For this reason, it is very important to always check the documentation of the software the potential will be used with to verify it is correctly implemented.</li><li><b>Alternate equivalent parameterizations.</b>  The functional forms of interatomic potentials are often complex and involve parameters and/or functions that are not independent of each other.  As such, there may be multiple ways of parameterizing a potential in a given format that results in the final functional form being mathematically equivalent.  One well known example of this is that the EAM potential equation allows for two different invariant transformations to be performed that alter how the pair, embedding, and electron density functions look but result in the same total energy for elemental interactions.  While these transformations do not alter elemental interactions, they do play a part in the cross-elemental interactions that multi-element alloy potentials include.  The issue of the EAM invariant transformations is discussed in several places, such as Y. Mishin, \"Interatomic potentials for metals,\" in <em>Handbook of Materials Modeling</em>, edited by S. Yip (Springer, Dordrect, The Netherlands, 2005), Chap. 2.2, pp. 459-478. and A.E. Carlsson, \"Beyond pair potentials in elemental transition metals and semiconductors,\" in <em>Solid State Physics</em>, Volume 43, Ehrenreich and Turnbull (eds.) (1990).</li><li><b>Publication typos.</b>  It is an unfortunate fact that the articles associated with interatomic potentials often contain typos that miss report information about the interatomic potentials.  Some examples are errors in the potential's functional form equations, incorrect values in the table of parameters, incorrect reported property values, or even reported values and parameters being for different parameterizations of the same functional form.  Such issues often result in published potentials being unreproducible from the associated articles alone.  For this reason, the Interatomic Potentials Repository primarily prefers to host parameter files obtained from the original creators/authors.  When first-party implementations are not available, we do our best to verify that any alternate implementations reproduce the reported results in the publication.</li></ul>"
