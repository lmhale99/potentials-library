        "answer": "The purpose of this project is to provide a repository of interatomic potentials for atomistic simulations (e.g. molecular dynamics) with comparison tools and reference experimental and ab-initio data in order to facilitate the evaluation of these potentials for particular applications. Our goal is not to judge that any particular potential is \"the best\" because the best interatomic potential may depend on the problem being considered. For example, some interatomic potentials which have been fit only to the properties of solid phases may model solid surface properties better than one fit with solid and liquid properties. However, the second potential will probably better represent properties which have a strong liquid contribution (e.g. crystal-melt interfacial properties). Additionally, we are not limiting the repository to a single class of material (e.g. metals), interatomic potential format (e.g. Embedded-Atom Method), or software package. As we obtain interatomic potentials for other materials or in other formats, we will include them with proper website modifications."
