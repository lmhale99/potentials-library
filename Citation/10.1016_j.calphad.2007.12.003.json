The new potential describes various fundamental physical properties of germanium: elastic, structural, point defect, surface, thermal properties (except melting point), etc., in better agreement with experimental data or first principles calculations than any other empirical potential ever developed. When compared to the previously developed MEAM Ge potential [M.I. Baskes, J.S. Nelson, A.F. Wright, Phys. Rev. B 40 (1989) 6085], certain improvements are made in descriptions of surface relaxations, point defects, thermal expansion and amorphous structure. The potential has the same formalism as already developed MEAM potentials for bcc, fcc and hcp elements, and can be easily extended to describe various metal–silicon multi-component systems.",
