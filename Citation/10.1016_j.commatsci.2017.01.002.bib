 abstract = {Interatomic potentials for the Co-Cr, Co-Fe, Co-Mn, Cr-Mn and Mn-Ni binary systems have been developed in the framework of the second nearest-neighbor modified embedded-atom method (2NN MEAM) formalism. The potentials describe various fundamental alloy behaviors (structural, elastic and thermodynamic behavior of solution and compound phases), mostly in reasonable agreements with experimental data or first-principles calculations. The potentials can be utilized to complete the interatomic potential for the CoCrFeMnNi alloy and to investigate the atomic scale physical metallurgy of high entropy alloys.},
