Particular attention has been paid to getting good elastic properties, including the relaxation volumes of small defect clusters, and to the interaction energy between hydrogen isotopes and typical irradiation-induced defects in tungsten. We conclude that the energy ordering of defects changes with the ratio of H atoms to point defects, indicating that this potential is suitable for exploring mechanisms of trap mutation, including vacancy loop to plate-like void transformations.",
