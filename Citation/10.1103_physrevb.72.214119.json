Fitting many-body functionals to the calculated mixing enthalpy of the alloy and the mixed interstitial binding energy in iron, our potential reproduces changes in sign of the formation energy as a function of Cr concentration. When applied in kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, the potential correctly predicts decomposition of initially random Fe-Cr alloys into the α-prime phase as function of Cr concentration.",
