 abstract = {A semi-empirical interatomic potential formalism, the second-nearest-neighbor modified embedded-atom method (2NN MEAM), has been applied to obtaining interatomic potentials for the Fe-Ni, Cr-Ni and Fe-Cr-Ni systems using previously developed MEAM potentials of Fe and Ni and a newly revised potential of Cr. The potential parameters were determined by fitting the experimental data on the enthalpy of formation or mixing, lattice parameter and elastic constant. The present potentials generally reproduced the fundamental physical properties of the Fe-Ni and Cr-Ni alloys. The enthalpy of formation or mixing of the disordered phase at finite temperature and the enthalpy of mixing of the liquid phase are reasonable in agreements with experiment data and CALPHAD calculations. The potentials can be combined with already-developed MEAM potentials to describe Fe-Cr-Ni-based multicomponent alloys. Moreover, the average diffusivities in the unary, some binary and ternary alloys were simulated based on present potential. Good agreement is obtained in comparison with experimental data.},
