 abstract = {A semi-empirical interatomic potential formalism, the second-nearest-neighbor modified embedded-atom method (2NN MEAM), has been applied to obtain interatomic potentials for Fe–Nb and Fe–Ti systems based on the previously developed potentials for pure Fe, Nb and Ti. The present potentials generally reproduce the fundamental physical properties of the Fe–Nb and Fe–Ti systems accurately. The potentials can be easily combined with already-developed MEAM potentials for binary carbide or nitride systems and can be used to describe Fe–(Ti,Nb)–(C,N) multicomponent systems.},
