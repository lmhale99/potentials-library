        "abstract": "Recent irradiation experiments have shown that smaller vacancy clusters are observed in Ni<sub>80</sub>Pd<sub>20</sub> compared to Ni<sub>80</sub>Fe<sub>20</sub>. Using atomistic calculations, we find that the vacancy energetics are significantly different between the two alloys. Ni<sub>80</sub>Pd<sub>20</sub> has lower vacancy migration barriers and lower vacancy-vacancy binding energies than Ni<sub>80</sub>Fe<sub>20</sub>. The consequence of these energetic differences is observed in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, where despite higher vacancy diffusivity that would help in cluster formation, significantly reduced vacancy clusters are observed in Ni<sub>80</sub>Pd<sub>20</sub> than Ni<sub>80</sub>Fe<sub>20</sub>. Calculations show that binding energy decreases and formation energy increases with increasing Ni-Ni bond lengths, and larger Ni-Ni bond lengths are observed in Ni<sub>80</sub>Pd<sub>20</sub> than Ni<sub>80</sub>Fe<sub>20</sub>. Thus, the reduced vacancy-vacancy binding and higher formation energy due to longer Ni-Ni bonds in Ni<sub>80</sub>Pd<sub>20</sub> are possibly the underlying reasons for smaller vacancy clusters in Ni<sub>80</sub>-Pd<sub>20</sub> than Ni<sub>80</sub>Fe<sub>20</sub>. This study illustrates the unique effects of alloying elements on defect energetics and microstructural evolution in random alloys.",
