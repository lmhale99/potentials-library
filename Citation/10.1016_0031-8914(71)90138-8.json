New parameter values for the like interactions were derived from recent accurate viscosity measurements, with an exception for helium. The parameter values for the (exp-6) model differ considerably from the commonly used values given by Mason. The description of the transport properties of neon, argon, krypton and xenon is in general improved with these new parameter values. However, the description of the second virial coefficient of the considered gases with the parameter values from transport properties is rather poor. The parameter values for the unlike interactions could be calculated with several combination rules, confirming the results obtained from recent diffusion measurements in noble-gas mixtures.",
