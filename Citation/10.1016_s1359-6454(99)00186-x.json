Copper preferentially segregates to the grain-boundary (GB) interstitial sites. The overall GB diffusivity is reduced with Cu segregation at GB sites. Calculation results predict that in Al(Cu) lines, Cu will diffuse first, with Al diffusion essentially suppressed because of a higher diffusion activation energy. The activation energy for Cu incubation diffusion is calculated to be 0.95 eV. The predictions are in excellent agreement with experiments.",
