Also, first-principles calculation has been carried out to provide data on the physical properties of this system, which are necessary for the optimization of the potential parameters. The developed potential reasonably reproduces the fundamental physical properties (thermodynamic, diffusion, elastic and volumetric properties) of V-rich bcc solid solution and some of the vanadium hydride phases. The applicability of this potential to the development of V-based alloys for hydrogen applications is discussed.",
