Searching the energy landscape predicted by the potential using a genetic algorithm verifies that it reproduces not only the correct bcc ground state of molybdenum but also all low-energy metastable phases. The potential is also applicable to the study of plastic deformation and used to compute energies, core structures, and Peierls stresses of screw and edge dislocations.",
