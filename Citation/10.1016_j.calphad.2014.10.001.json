The potentials can describe various fundamental physical properties of pure Ca (bulk, defect and thermal properties) and the alloy behavior (structural, thermodynamic and defect properties of solid solutions and compounds) of binary systems in reasonable agreement with experimental data or first-principles and other calculations. The applicability of the developed potentials to atomistic investigations of the deformation behavior of Mg and its alloys is discussed together with some challenging points that need further attention.",
