 abstract = {We propose a bond order potential for carbon with built-in long-range interactions. The potential is defined as the sum of an angular and coordination dependent short-range part accounting for the strong covalent interactions and a radial long-range part describing the weak interactions responsible, e.g., for the interplanar binding in graphite. The short-range part is a Brenner type of potential, with several modifications introduced to get an improved description of elastic properties and conjugation. Contrary to previous long-range extensions of existing bond order potentials, we prevent the loss of accuracy by compensating for the additional long-range interactions by an appropriate parametrization of the short-range part. We also provide a short-range bond order potential. In Monte Carlo simulations our potential gives a good description of the diamond to graphite transformation. For thin (111) slabs graphitization proceeds perpendicular to the surface as found in ab initio simulations, whereas for thick layers we find that graphitization occurs layer by layer.},
