        "abstract": "We present a new classical interatomic potential for a study of the binary Zr-Nb system, taking into account a wide range of the components concentrations. The potential was developed by virtue of the force-matching method that is capable of ensuring a high accuracy at the description of the complex systems containing diverse crystal phases. At simulation of pure Zr, the potential correctly describes a relative stability of Zr phases (α-Zr, β-Zr and ω-Zr) and qualitatively reproduces the right arrangement of these phases in the phase diagram. It is remarkable that β-Zr phase is found to have a dynamically unstable structure at the low temperature, in agreement with the <i>ab initio</i> calculations. The potential can also play a role in considering the tasks related to the crystal defects in the Zr-Nb system. In support of this statement, we show the simulation results proving adequate representation of a number of key properties of the crystal defects in Zr-Nb system. In particular, the offered potential reproduces formation/solution energies of point defects with well accuracy. To illustrate wide application possibilities for the model, we made a prediction of atomic self-diffusion and impurity diffusion in Zr and Nb. Also, the potential ensures correct description of a screw dislocation in niobium, which is a crucial point for the investigation of plasticity.",
