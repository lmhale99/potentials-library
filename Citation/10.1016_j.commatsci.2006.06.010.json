The potential parameters have been determined based on ab initio calculations of small molecules and the experimental data of α-quartz. The structural properties of various silica polymorphs calculated by using the new potential were in good agreement with their experimental data and ab initio calculation results. Furthermore, we have prepared SiO<sub>2</sub> glass using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations by rapid quenching of melted SiO<sub>2</sub>. The radial distribution function and phonon density of states of SiO<sub>2</sub> glass generated by MD simulation were in excellent agreement with those of SiO<sub>2</sub> glass obtained experimentally.",
