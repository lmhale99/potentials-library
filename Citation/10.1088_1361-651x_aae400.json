The ADP potential reproduces a wide range of properties of both elements as well as binary alloys with reasonable accuracy, including thermal and mechanical properties, defects, melting points of Ni and Cr, and the Ni–Cr phase diagram. The potential can be used for atomistic simulations of solidification, mechanical behavior and microstructure of the Ni-based and Cr-based phases as well as two-phase alloys.",
