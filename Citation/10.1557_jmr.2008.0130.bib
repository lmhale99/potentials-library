 abstract = {A modified embedded-atom method (MEAM) interatomic potential for the Cu–Zr system has been developed based on the previously developed MEAM potentials for pure Cu and Zr. The potential describes fundamental physical properties and alloy behavior of the Cu–Zr binary system reasonably well. The applicability of the potential to atomistic investigations of mechanical and deformation behavior for the Cu–Zr binary and Cu–Zr-based multicomponent amorphous alloys is also demonstrated by showing that fully relaxed and realistic amorphous structures can be generated by molecular dynamics simulations.},
