In this work, a combined experimental and simulation approach uses an automated closed loop via an active learner, which is initialized by x-ray and neutron diffraction measurements, and sequentially improves a machine-learning model until the experimentally predetermined phase space is covered. A multiphase potential is generated for a canonical example of the archetypal refractory oxide, HfO<sub>2</sub>, by drawing a minimum number of training configurations from room temperature to the liquid state at ~2900°C. The method significantly reduces model development time and human effort.",
