The MD simulation showed a layer-by-layer solid-liquid interface (SLI) motion mechanism in the [001] direction. The SLI migration seems to be satisfactorily described by Wilson-Frenkel theory in the temperature interval from 0.7T<sub>m</sub> to T<sub>m</sub>. It was found that the SLI passes an atomic plane as soon as the Sm sublattice is formed while the Al sublattice keeps forming for a while after that, and high Al diffusivity is observed in the solid phase. Those unsettled Al atoms trapped in solid phase will leave vacancies and form defects.",
