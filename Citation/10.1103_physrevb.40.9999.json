For high coverages, vacancy formation on the Si(111) is strongly endothermic in agreement with tight-binding calculations and quantum-chemical calculations on clusters. For the √3 × √3 structure, the vacancy formation energy is 1.5 eV/vacancy. Thus, the vacancy model for the √3 × √3 surface, based on low-energy electron-diffraction data, is not energetically favorable.",
