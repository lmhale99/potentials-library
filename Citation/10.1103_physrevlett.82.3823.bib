 abstract = {We have measured the velocity of a running crack in brittle single crystal silicon as a function of energy flow to the crack tip. The experiments are designed to permit direct comparison with molecular dynamics simulations; therefore the experiments provide an indirect but sensitive test of interatomic potentials. Performing molecular dynamics simulations of brittle crack motion at the atomic scale we find that experiments and simulations disagree showing that interatomic potentials are not yet well understood.},
