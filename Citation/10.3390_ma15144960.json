In this article, a new parametrization of the analytical bond-order potential has been developed for InP. The potential reproduces fundamental physical properties (lattice parameters, cohesive energy, stiffness coefficients) of the B3 and B1 phases in good agreement with first-principles calculations. The proposed interaction model describes the reversibility of the pressure-induced B3↔B1 phase transition as well as the formation of native point defects in the B3 phase.",
