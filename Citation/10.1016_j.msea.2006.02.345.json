The potential describes thermodynamic properties and alloy behaviors of the Cu–Ti binary system fairly well. The procedure for the determination of potential parameter values and the performance of the optimized alloy potential are presented. The possibility and limitations of the potential for application to atomistic studies of Cu-based amorphous alloys are also discussed.",
