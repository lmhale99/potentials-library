Very large atom-centred basis sets including a newly developed d-aug-cc-pV8Z basis set supplemented with bond functions and <i>ab initio</i> methods up to full CI were applied. The aug-cc-pV7Z basis set of Gdanitz (J. Chem. Phys. <b>113</b>, 5145 (2000)) was modified to be more consistent with the aug-cc-pV5Z and aug-cc-pV6Z basis sets.
