        "abstract": "Determining the structure-property relations of liquid and amorphous metal oxides is challenging, due to their variable short-range order and polyhedral connectivity. To predict chemically realistic structures, we have developed a Machine Learned, Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) for HfO<sub>2</sub>, with a focus on enhanced sampling of the training database and accurate density functional theory calculations. By using training datasets for the GAP model at the level of Density Functional Theory-Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (DFT-SCAN) level of theory, our results show that the topology of both the low viscosity liquid and the amorphous form are dominated by edge-shared chains and small corner-shared rings of polyhedra. This topology is shown to be consistent with the structure of other liquid and amorphous transition metal oxides of variable ion size, such as TiO<sub>2</sub> and ZrO<sub>2</sub>. Current limitations of the ML-GAP modeling method for obtaining glass structures and future perspectives are also discussed.",
