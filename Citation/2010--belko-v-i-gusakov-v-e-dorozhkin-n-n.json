This is due to the fact that within methods using empirical potentials, it is possible to simulate ensembles containing more than 10<sup>6</sup> atoms.  Interatomic potential for this type of an atomic system is determined by a set of parameters, which, in turn, depends on the functional form of the potential [1].  Determination of the parameters of the empirical potential is a key point in its development.  There are two approach for parameterization of potential: parameterization using experimental data; use of data obtained <i>from first principles</i>.  In our opinion, the second method is more consistent, since, as a rule, experimental data for the test material are usually very limited. This paper presents the results on the parametrization of the potential EDIP for the study of germanium and silicon-germanium alloys.},\n address = {Minsk, Belarus},\n author = {V. I. Belko and V. E.
