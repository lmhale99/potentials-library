 abstract = {A new analytic bond-order potential for iron is presented that has been fitted to experimental data and results from first-principles calculations. The angular-dependent functional form allows a proper description of a large variety of bulk, surface and defect properties, including the Bain path, phonon dispersions, defect diffusivities and defect formation energies. By calculating Gibbs free energies of body-centred cubic (bcc) and face-centred cubic (fcc) iron as a function of temperature, we show that this potential is able to reproduce the transitions from α-iron to γ-iron and δ-iron before the melting point. The results are compared to four widely used embedded-atom-method potentials for iron.},
