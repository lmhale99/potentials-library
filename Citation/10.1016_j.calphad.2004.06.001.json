The procedure for the determination of potential parameter values is presented. It is shown that the potential describes the basic thermodynamic properties and alloy behaviors of the fcc solid solution (enthalpy of mixing, miscibility gap and lattice parameter) in good agreement with CALPHAD calculation and experimental information. It is also shown how the CALPHAD calculation (enthalpy of mixing) can be used for optimization of the interatomic potential parameters.",
