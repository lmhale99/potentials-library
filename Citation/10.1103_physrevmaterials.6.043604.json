The new potential allows to simulate Fe-Cr alloys for a wide range of compositions and different concentrations of hydrogen. The angular-dependent format of the model and the development procedure based on the machine learning approach allow to achieve a favorable balance between the computation cost and the reliability of the created parametrization. As part of potential validation, we performed a large number of tests of both the binary metallic alloys and hydrogen interactions. The applicability of the potential is demonstrated by large-scale simulations of hydrogen diffusion in the vicinity of crystal defects.",
