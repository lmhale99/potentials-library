Our search reveals a \"magic\" cluster number of three atoms, where the formation energy per interstitial shows a distinct minimum. A carbon tri-interstitial cluster with trigonal C<sub>3v</sub> symmetry is discovered, in which all carbon atoms are fourfold coordinated. In addition to its special thermodynamic stability, its localized vibrational modes are also in a very good agreement with the experimental photoluminescence spectra of the D<sub>II</sub> center in both 3C- and 4H-SiC. The D<sub>II</sub> center is one of the most persistent defects in SiC, and we propose that the discovered carbon tri-interstitial is responsible for this center.",
