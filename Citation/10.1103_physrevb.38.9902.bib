 abstract = {An alternative parametrization is given for a previous empirical interatomic potential for silicon. The new potential is designed to more accurately reproduce the elastic properties of silicon, which were poorly described in the earlier potential. The properties of liquid Si are also improved, but energies of surfaces are less accurate. Detailed tests of the new potential are described.},
