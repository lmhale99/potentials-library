 abstract = {Density-functional theory energies, forces, and elastic constants determine the parametrization of an empirical, modified embedded-atom method potential for molybdenum. The accuracy and transferability of the potential are verified by comparison to experimental and density-functional data for point defects, phonons, thermal expansion, surface and stacking fault energies, and ideal shear strength. Searching the energy landscape predicted by the potential using a genetic algorithm verifies that it reproduces not only the correct bcc ground state of molybdenum but also all low-energy metastable phases. The potential is also applicable to the study of plastic deformation and used to compute energies, core structures, and Peierls stresses of screw and edge dislocations.},
