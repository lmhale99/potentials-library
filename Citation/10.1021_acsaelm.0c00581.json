        "abstract": "In the upcoming process to overcome the limitations of the standard von Neumann architecture, synaptic electronics is gaining a primary role for the development of in-memory computing. In this field, Ge-based compounds have been proposed as switching materials for nonvolatile memory devices and for selectors. By employing the classical molecular dynamics, we study the structural features of both the liquid states at 1500 K and the amorphous phase at 300 K of Ge-rich and Se-rich chalcogenides binary Ge<sub>x</sub>Se<sub>1-x</sub> systems in the range 0.4 ≤ x ≤ 0.6. The simulations rely on a model of interatomic potentials where ions interact through steric repulsion, as well as Coulomb and charge-dipole interactions given by the large electronic polarizability of Se ions. Our results indicate the formation of temperature-dependent hierarchical structures with short-range local orders and medium-range structures, which vary with the Ge content. Our work demonstrates that nanosecond-long simulations, not accessible via <i>ab initio</i> techniques, are required to obtain a realistic amorphous phase from the melt. Our classical molecular dynamics simulations are able to describe the profound structural differences between the melt and the glassy structures of GeSe chalcogenides. These results open to the understanding of the interplay between chemical composition, atomic structure, and electrical properties in switching materials.",
