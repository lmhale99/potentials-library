The potential can describe various fundamental physical properties of Fe–Al binary alloys—structural, elastic and thermodynamic properties, defect formation behavior and interactions between defects—in reasonable agreement with experimental data or higher-level calculations. The applicability of the potential to atomistic investigations of various defect formation behaviors and their effects on the mechanical properties of high aluminum steels as well as Fe–Al binary alloys is demonstrated.",
