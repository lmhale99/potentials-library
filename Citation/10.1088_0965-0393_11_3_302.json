Optimization of the Cu–Pb potential was achieved by comparing with experiment the computed heats of mixing for Cu–Pb liquid alloys and the equilibrium phase diagram, the latter being determined via a thermodynamic integration technique. The topology of the temperature-composition phase diagram computed with this EAM potential is consistent with experiment and features a liquid–liquid miscibility gap, low solubility of Pb in solid Cu and a monotectic reaction at approximately 1012 K.",
