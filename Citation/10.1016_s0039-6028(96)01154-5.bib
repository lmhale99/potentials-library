 abstract = {A set of embedded-atom method (EAM) potentials for Al-Mg alloys are developed using the "force matching" method. The potentials are fitted to both experimental data and a massive quantum mechanical database of atomic forces at finite temperatures. Using the potentials, Monte Carlo simulations are performed to study Mg segregation at different low-index surfaces of an Al alloy with 1â€“10 at% Mg. Surface enrichments of Mg of the order of 80% are found, and the segregation behavior is generally anisotropic. A set of discrete lattice-plane calculations, based on the nearest-neighbor broken-bond model corrected for strain energy, are shown to drastically reduce the anisotropy of surface segregation.},
