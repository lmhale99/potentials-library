The potentials can describe various physical properties (structural, elastic and defect properties) of both zinc-blende and wurtzite-type GaN and InN as well as those of constituent elements, in good agreement with experimental data or high-level calculations. The potential can also describe the structural behavior of Ga<sub>1-x</sub>In<sub>x</sub>N ternary nitrides reasonably well. The applicability of the potentials to atomistic investigations of atomic/nanoscale structural evolution in Ga<sub>1-x</sub>In<sub>x</sub>N multi-component nitrides during the deposition of constituent element atoms is discussed.",
