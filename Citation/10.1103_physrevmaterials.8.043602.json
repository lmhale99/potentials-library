By using an extensive set of Cu-Zr training data generated withdensity functional theory, this potential describes a wide range of properties of crystalline as well as amorphous phases within the whole compositional range. Therefore, the machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) can reproduce the experimental phase diagram and amorphous structure with considerably improved accuracy.
