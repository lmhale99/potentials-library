 abstract = {An empirical interatomic potential for covalent systems is proposed, incorporating bond order in an intuitive way. The potential has the form of a Morse pair potential, but with the bond-strength parameter depending upon local environment. A model for Si accurately describes bonding and geometry for may structures, including highly rebonded surfaces.},
