The potentials can describe various fundamental physical properties of pure Y (the bulk, defect and thermal properties) and the alloy behaviors (structural, thermodynamic and defect properties of solid solutions and compounds) of constituent systems in reasonable agreement with experimental data or first-principles calculations.",
