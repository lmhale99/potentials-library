The applicability of the potential to atomistic investigations of mechanical and deformation behavior for the Cu–Zr binary and Cu–Zr-based multicomponent amorphous alloys is also demonstrated by showing that fully relaxed and realistic amorphous structures can be generated by molecular dynamics simulations.",
